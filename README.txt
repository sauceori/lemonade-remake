lemonade-remake
This project aims to recreate the 1979 Apple II game, Lemonade Stand, in Python solely using the
terminal and text graphics. lemonade-remake aims to recreate the mechanics of the original game by
referencing the original Applesoft Basic code. The original Lemonade Stand was created partially as
a teaching tool for students to learn about the basics of business management, this remake aims to
have a similar educational slant for aspiring programmers by adhering well to Python conventions
and providing ample documentation.
