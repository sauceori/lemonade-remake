lemonade-remake
This project aims to recreate the 1979 Apple II game, Lemonade Stand, in
Python solely using the terminal and text graphics. lemonade-remake aims to
recreate the mechanics of the original game by referencing the original
Applesoft Basic code. The original Lemonade Stand was created partially as
a teaching tool for students to learn about the basics of business
management, this remake aims to have a similar educational slant for
aspiring programmers by adhering well to Python conventions and providing
ample documentation.
    This project could later be turned into a graphical application using
PyGame.
